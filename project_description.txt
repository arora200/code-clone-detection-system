I've created a comprehensive Python implementation for your code clone detection system that includes all the components mentioned in your document. Here's what the implementation covers:


Key Features:
1. GitHub Data Collection

Automated collection of Python CLI projects from GitHub
Code extraction and preprocessing capabilities

2. Feature Engineering (17 metrics as per document)

Structural code metrics (lines, functions, classes, etc.)
Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, Halstead metrics)
Maintainability index calculation
Sequence of Code (SoC) features

3. Deep Learning Baselines

CodeBERT: Transformer-based model for code understanding
Graph Neural Networks (GNN): For code structure representation
Simple Neural Network: Baseline deep learning model

4. Meta-Classifier System

Implementation of Algorithm 2 from your document
Stacking architecture with two-layer ensemble
All combinations evaluation of top 5 classifiers
Cross-validation for robust performance

5. State-of-the-Art Comparison

All 22 classifiers mentioned in Table 3.5
Traditional ML models (RandomForest, GradientBoosting, etc.)
Deep learning models
Meta-classifier ensemble

6. Comprehensive Visualizations

Performance metrics comparison charts
Time complexity analysis
Performance heatmaps
Radar charts for multi-metric comparison
Distribution box plots by model type
Learning curves

7. Complete Pipeline

End-to-end execution from data collection to results
Synthetic data generation for testing
Real GitHub data support
Results export to CSV

How to Use:

Install Required Dependencies:

bashpip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
pip install torch transformers
pip install gitpython requests
pip install lightgbm  # Optional
pip install torch-geometric  # Optional for GNN

Basic Usage:

python# Run with synthetic data (for testing)
pipeline = CodeCloneDetectionPipeline()
results = pipeline.run_full_pipeline(use_synthetic=True)

Using Real GitHub Data:

python# Provide your GitHub token for higher API limits
pipeline = CodeCloneDetectionPipeline()
results = pipeline.run_full_pipeline(
    use_synthetic=False,
    github_token="your_github_token_here"
)
Key Outputs:

Performance Metrics Table: Comparing all models on accuracy, F1-score, balanced accuracy, ROC-AUC
Visualizations: 6 different types of charts saved in ./results/ folder
CSV Report: Detailed results exported to comparison_results.csv
Console Output: Real-time training progress and summary statistics

Implementation Highlights:

Meta-Classifier Construction: Exactly follows the methodology in Section 3.11.1 of your document
Top 5 Classifiers: RandomForest, GradientBoosting, DecisionTree, LogisticRegression, and LabelPropagation as specified
Two-Phase Training: Base classifiers first, then meta-classifier training on predictions
5-Fold Cross-Validation: For robust performance estimation
All Combinations Testing: Evaluates all possible combinations of 3 base + 1 meta classifier

The system is modular and extensible, allowing you to easily add new models or modify the feature extraction process. The implementation provides a complete framework for comparing the meta-classifier approach with both traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines.
